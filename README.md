# Artist Codex Protocol

A protocol that allows artists and creators to create their own onchain codexes.

## Overview

A codex acts as a personal public diary allowing thoughts, fun facts, cheat codes, ideas, etc. to be recorded and connected as NFTs onchain. Artists/creators can start as many self-sovereign codexes as they like. After starting a codex (ERC721 contract), its owners can create sections (ERC721 contracts) to organize the content as they wish.

## Linking content

Since each content within a section is an NFT they can be linked to each other creating relationships in a "context network".
